# JS-Webcam-Display
This is just a project which involved me trying to access the webcam with JavaScript

I was able to do it with something called Media Devices

It's pretty neat, ngl (Not gonna lie)

This might come in handy when you like don't knwo how to use webcam and you want to record your face so yeah

besides that, this is pretty useless

but still quite neat
